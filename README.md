<h1>Hi👋, I'm Habeeb!</h1>

I'm an IT graduate aspiring to be a Cybersecurity professional. My goal is to contribute to the protection of sensitive information and critical infrastructures 
against cyber threats. I am particularly interested in roles such as Security Analyst, IT Support Specialist, System Administrator, and Jr. Penetration 
Tester.

While these roles are of particular interest to me, I am also open to other entry-level cybersecurity roles that would allow me to gain practical experience 
and further develop my skills. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to make 
a meaningful impact in the field of cybersecurity. At the same time, I publish insightful Medium blogs delving into the realm of cybersecurity, sharing the knowledge and insights I've acquired on various pertinent topics.
